# Shortest Path using DFS (backend - GO, Frontend - React)

>Build a full-stack application where the user interacts with a 20x20 grid to select two tiles (start and end), and the shortest path between them is calculated using Depth-First Search (DFS). The path will be calculated on the backend (Go) and returned to the frontend, where it will be displayed by highlighting the path in a different color.
